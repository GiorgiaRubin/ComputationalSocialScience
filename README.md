Quantitative analysis about NFTs using Twitter API

How can we define NFTs? 
Are they works of art or are they rather objects for exchanging cryptocurrencies?
How do people talk about them on Twitter, one of the most used social platforms for news about NFTs? 
What terms do twitter users use to talk about NFTs in their posts? And thus classify them as objects of art, as objects of economy or rather as a hybrid of the two?
