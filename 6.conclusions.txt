What emerges from the results of the analysis carried out is that among the six keywords extracted from the tweets, 'art' is both the most represented in our barchart, i.e. overall the most mentioned in the tweets, and the most connected in our network. This means that in the 3,000 tweets analysed, Twitter users talk about NFTs by associating them with the word "art" more than they do by associating them with the other extracted keywords.

In second place among the most quoted keywords we have 'eth' (the cryptocurrency Ethereum), with a considerable gap of points compared to the more quoted 'art', but with a citation count more or less equal to the other two keywords 'sold' and 'price' belonging to the same economic category. Compared to its two companions, however, 'eth' has a much higher connection to tweets, evidenced by the results obtained from the network analysis on degrees for nodes and their centrality. Moreover, it is much more connected to keywords belonging to the art category than are 'sold' and 'price'. This means that, despite the similar number of mentions, around 120, for all three words of the economy category, "eth" is the one most distributed in the tweets and most closely related to the three words of the art category and that, on the contrary, "sold" and "price" are repeated several times within the same tweets, thus lowering their level of centrality in the network.

Furthermore, the other two words in the art category "nftart" and "nftartist", despite being present at the last two places in our barchart with a level of mentions respectively about half and a third of that of the words of economics, present a more distributed number of connections in our network.

These analyses show that Twitter users talk about NFTs on the social using both artistic and economic terms to a considerable extent, but that firstly, most of the analysed tweets define NFTs as art objects, secondly they define them as economic objects and finally they talk about them as hybrid objects using terms belonging to both categories.
