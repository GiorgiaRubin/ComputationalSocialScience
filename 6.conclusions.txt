What emerges from the results of the analysis carried out is that among the six keywords extracted from the tweets, 'art' is both the most represented in our barchart, i.e. overall the most mentioned in the tweets, and the most connected in our network. This means that in the 3,000 tweets analysed, Twitter users talk about NFTs by associating them with the word "art" more than they do by associating them with the other extracted keywords.
